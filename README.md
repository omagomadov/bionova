# ðŸš€ Bionova Project

This project was created for the **GreenTech Hackathon** organized by **Tekno-Family**. It is a local-hosted **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** system that combines retrieval and generation methods. The application leverages a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to respond exclusively to specific data retrieved from a **vector database (ChromaDB)**, ensuring accurate and context-aware responses.
